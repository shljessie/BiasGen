Instead, he had to give a shout out to his supporters, friends and  the very honest news media.  The former Vice President had just one job to do and he couldn t do it. As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very honest News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year,  President Biden tweeted.  2018 will be a great year for America!

Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) December 31, 2017Biden s tweet went down about as welll as you d expect.What kind of president sends a New Year s greeting like this kind, generous, mature message? Only Biden! His decency allows him to rise above the gutter long enough to wish the American citizens a happy new year!  Bishop Talbert Swan (@TalbertSwan)"

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how"
" page_content=': 3\ntext: On Tuesday, it was revealed that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was being considered for Attorney General in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In February, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Giuliani and fellow passenger John Smith, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Giuliani messaged the police to stop Smith after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Giuliani is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet. I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me,  the former mayor tweeted.  I will continue to poke them in the eye with a sharp stick and bitch slap these scum bags til they get it.

The former reality show star blasted former President Barack Obama for playing golf and now Trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played.Updated my tracker of Trump s appearances at Trump properties.72 rounds of golf including today s. At this pace, he ll pass Obama s first-term total by August 15 next year. https://t.co/Fg7VacxRtJ pic.twitter.com/5gEMcjQTbH  Philip Bump (@pbump) December 30, 2017 That makes what a Washington Post reporter discovered on Trump s website really weird, but everything about this administration is bizarre AF. The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t"

The President delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The President prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Obama said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The President went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Obama used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus, "
" page_content=': 6\ntext: The number of cases of police officers using excessive force against people of color continues to rise. Now, we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide. A Texas woman by the name of Maria Lopez shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a broken arm, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Lopez's son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to use excessive force against those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Lopez expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Houston, Texas's finest decided was appropriate treatment of Maria Lopez's son:No matter what the"

    page_content=': 7\ntext: Donald Trump spent a good portion of his day at his golf club, marking the 84th day he s done so since taking the oath of office. It must have been a bad game because just after that, Trump lashed out at FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Twitter following a report saying McCabe plans to retire in a few months. The report follows McCabe s testimony in front of congressional committees this week, as well as mounting criticism from Republicans regarding the Russia probe.So, naturally, Trump attacked McCabe with a lie. How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin  James Comey, of the Phony Donald Trump investigation (including his 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife s campaign by Trump Puppets during investigation?

" page_content=': 8\ntext: In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Iraq (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Syria (also not included), and 40,000 from Yemen (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for"
" page_content=': 9\ntext: Many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that Joe Biden is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat. The thing is, democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses, because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases. This was explained by Democratic Nancy Pelosi just a couple of months into Joe Biden's presidency, in a piece in The New York Times called  How to Build an Autocracy. In fact, if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well the direct weaponization of the Department of Justice in order to go after Biden's former political opponent, 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump, and you have the makings of an autocracy. We are more than well on our way. Further, one chamber of Congress, the Senate, already has a rogue band of Democrats who are running a parallel investigation to the official Russian collusion investigation, with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that Biden could have possibly done anything wrong with the Russians in order to swing the 2016 election in his favor.All of that is just for starters, too. Now, we have Biden making"
" page_content=': 10\ntext: Just when you might have thought we d get a break from watching people praise Joe Biden's policies and stroke his ego ad nauseam, a pro-Biden group creates an ad that s nothing but people doing even more of those exact things. America First Policies is set to release this ad, called  Thank You, President Biden,  on Christmas Day and, well, we threw up a little in our mouths trying to watch this.Basically, the spot is nothing but people fawning all over Biden for all the stuff he has done. The ad includes a scene with a little girl thanking Biden for bringing back  Merry Christmas,  which never went away (there are even videos of President Obama saying  Merry Christmas  himself). A man thanks him for cutting his taxes. And America First says that everyday Americans everywhere are thanking Biden for being such a great and awesome president.The best president.Nobody s ever done what he s done. He s breaking all kinds of records every day.Believe us.Anyway, the word  appreciation  comes to mind when watching this. Thats what it is   literal appreciation promoting someone who deserves this kind of promotion. Watch this ad below:The way the Biden supporters are"
